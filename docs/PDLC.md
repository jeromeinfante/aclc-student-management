# Program Development Life Cycle

The Program Development Life Cycle (PDLC) is a process used in software engineering to manage the development of software programs


## 5 Stages of PDLC

1. Analyze the Problem: During the initial phase of the Program Development Life Cycle (PDLC), the focus is on understanding and analyzing the problem at hand. This involves gathering requirements, studying existing systems, and identifying the goals and constraints of the program. The aim is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem, ensuring that the subsequent development stages are informed by a clear and accurate assessment.

- Requirements gathering
- Organizing Requirements
- Negotiation and Discussion
- Documentation

2. Design the Program:In the design phase, the high-level blueprint of the program is created. This includes defining the architecture, data structures, algorithms, and user interfaces. The emphasis is on converting the requirements gathered in the analysis phase into a structured plan for implementation. This stage lays the foundation for the coding phase, providing a roadmap for developers to follow.

- Pseudocode
- Algorithms

3. Coding and Execution: The coding phase involves translating the design specifications into actual code. Developers write, compile, and execute the program based on the design documentation. This is the stage where the bulk of the programming work occurs, and the envisioned solution takes shape in the form of executable code. Regular testing and debugging may be performed during this phase to ensure the code functions as intended.

4. Testing and Debugging: Testing is a critical phase to validate the functionality of the program and identify and rectify any errors or bugs. Testing involves both unit testing (testing individual components) and system testing (testing the entire program). Debugging is the process of locating and fixing defects in the code. This iterative phase ensures that the program meets the specified requirements and functions correctly under various conditions.

5. Formalize the Solution: After successful testing and debugging, the solution is formalized, and any necessary adjustments are made. This phase involves preparing the program for deployment, making sure it is stable, efficient, and ready for use in a production environment. It may also include optimizing the code, enhancing performance, and addressing any remaining issues identified during testing.

6. Documentation: Documentation is a crucial aspect of the PDLC. It involves creating detailed documentation that describes the program's functionality, design, and usage. This documentation serves as a reference for developers, users, and future maintainers of the program. It includes technical specifications, user manuals, and any other relevant information necessary for understanding, using, and maintaining the program over time. Good documentation is essential for the long-term sustainability of the software solution.
