# ACLC Student Management System

> A simple Full Stack Web Application that stores the students info.

In a bustling educational environment, managing student
information efficiently and effectively poses a significant
challenge. The existing manual methods of record-keeping and
student data management are prone to errors, time-consuming,
and lack the scalability needed to accommodate the growing
student population. Educational institutions, such as
schools, face the need for a streamlined and automated
system that can handle various aspects of student management
seamlessly.
